## What is it?

Collection of [Bookmarklets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) I created to scrape web page information and download a JSON file. It was made due to the necessity of providing sample data such as different file types or media to personal projects, and Lorem Ipsum was not enough.

## Why use it?

Simple, Who got time for that? Just grab the samples and get back to the fun stuff. Working smart and not hard rings true for this one.

## How to use it?

Drag the bookmarklet link from the info page to your browser bookmarks or right click and bookmark it, that simple.
